## Purpose

This dashboard provides a comprehensive visual analysis of customer purchases related to food preparation in 2022. It aims to understand purchasing trends, identify popular products, analyze customer behavior, and visualize the geographic distribution of sales during this period. The dashboard offers key metrics and insights to inform potential business decisions related to inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

## Data Sources

The data for this dashboard is sourced from an Excel file containing transactional data. The specific file used is included in this repository:

* `COVID Food Preparation 2022.xlsx`

This file contains information on product sales, customer details, order dates, pricing, production costs, and customer locations.

## Key Insights

The dashboard reveals several key insights about purchasing behavior:

* **Top Selling Products:**  The "Units Sold by Product Name" chart clearly identifies the most popular items purchased, highlighting products like the "Multitool Survival Kit," "Nylon Rope," and "Duct Tape" as having the highest sales volume.
* **Customer Purchase Patterns:** The "Customer Purchase Breakdown" visually demonstrates the mix of products purchased by individual customers, revealing their preferences and common combinations of items. This can help understand customer needs and tailor product recommendations.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** The dashboard prominently displays key metrics such as "Total Orders Placed," "Minimum Order Value," and "Sum of Total Purchased," providing a quick overview of overall sales activity and transaction values.
* **Customer Segmentation:** The "Customer" table ranks customers by their total units purchased, allowing for easy identification of top customers and high-value accounts.
* **Geographic Sales Distribution:** The "Total Purchased by State" donut chart illustrates the distribution of sales across different states, highlighting key regions and potential areas for further market penetration.
* **Product Purchase Trends Over Time:** The "Products Purchased by Date" line chart showcases the purchasing trends of specific products over time, allowing for the identification of seasonal patterns, spikes in demand, or the impact of external factors on product popularity.
* **Price and Production Cost Analysis:** The "Price and Production Cost by Product Name" visualizations (both bar and scatter plots) provide insights into the profitability of different products by comparing their selling price against their production cost. This helps identify products with high-profit margins and potential cost optimization opportunities.
